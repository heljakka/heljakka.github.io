title: Decay, But With Your Foot on The Brake

In nearly every discussion about anything at all, the inevitable fact of human aging looms as the single greatest elephant in the room. After all, biological aging means that <i>every single second is pushing us towards deterioration, loss of function, and death.</i> How to take a sober approach to it, while acknowledging the biotech revolution underway?

Few things are more dramatic and impactful than aging. Yet, if you opt to ignore it, you allow yourself to waste time in endless tiny worries, and risk selling your precise limited seconds to the Reaper at a steep discount.

Yes, there was a time one could make a reasonable excuse, along the lines of: "Nothing can be done about it, hence, it is best to just learn to accept."

That time was 15–20 years ago. Before the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/05/03/will-you-live-to-200-five-levels-of-breakthroughs-in-longevity-research-you-must-know-about"> present-day anti-aging science</a>.

With every passing year, science is making it clearer that you can affect your effective rate of aging. Here, by aging I mean '<i>the progressively increasing chance of contracting health issues correlated with chronological age</i>.'

But there is a fundamental flaw in the way these ideas tend to be discussed. The concepts of lifespan, "healthspan", and even biological age can easily mislead us. <i>Rate-of-aging</i> turns out to make slightly more sense, enough to upgrade your world view. This article attempts to explain why.

## From Span to Rate
There are 2 critical first steps to take towards "longevity mindset", and most people seem to only take the 1st one.

<b>Step #1</b> is about accepting that you can have power over your aging. This alone will make you change your view on many things: Your life style, personal risk-taking, the time range of planning. How you view society, and retirement, obviously. (Even environmental concerns: If you expect to be around, you will likely be more interested in the condition of the planet.)

<b>Step #2</b> is about realizing that there is a whole edifice of age-related thinking that just stopped making sense. And it needs to be torn down.

The problem is that even after step #1, many people still express longevity in terms of the "span" of life. Even Dr. David Sinclair, the anti-aging research giant, opted to name his seminal book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lifespan-Why-Age_and-Dont-Have/dp/1501191977">"Lifespan"</a>, while many others have used the term "healthspan" &mdash; the part of our lives during which we remain free of significant sickness (similar to <a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/indicator-metadata-registry/imr-details/66">Healthy Life Exceptancy</a>).

The whole mental model of "span", however, is terribly misleading. In terms of the subjective experience and the objective risk of contracting "age-related" diseases, the shorter adult <i>healthspan</i> must correspond to a faster <i>rate-of-aging</i>.

To see the gap between the two notions, consider that people have little trouble in casually discussing a "good" or "desirable" maximum lifespan. But, I have yet to meet the first sane person who seriously prefers to decay faster rather than slower &mdash; after all, it comes down to making you weaker and more prone to ailments!

Let's look at some hairy problems with this prevalent "span" frame.

1. The expected <i>life</i> span does not tell you what is your expected <i>health</i> at a higher age. This often leads people to argue that they do <i>not</i> want a long life, since that entails a prolonged stage of "Fragile Old Age". The <i>health</i>span concept blocks that strange line of thought  somewhat. However, this only takes us so far.

2. As soon as you account for the many degrees of the experienced levels of health (and well-being), any binary notion of the uniform periods of health vs. non-health is obviously troublesome, and the "healthspan" itself becomes almost a self-contradictory notion: Is it the amount of time you will remain "at health" before you, suddenly, begin to feel effects of a specific disease? In terms of its value as a personal goal, this makes as much sense as aiming to have 1.75 children, because, you know, that is the average. The concepts of population statistics translate poorly to individuals. A similar problem of uneven distribution occurs with the beautiful idea of 'longevity escape velocity' &mdash; the moment beyond which the life expectancy increases by at least 1 year every year (often promoted by, e.g., the great anti-aging pioneer Dr. Aubrey de Grey). It is problematic because a certain technological advance might mean the average +3 years for those born in 2000, but only +1 month for those born in 1960.

3. As soon as you expect the underlying pace of progress to potentially change, any idea of "expected X-span" is problematic for predictions about X. As the medical sciences march on, the average onset of diseases, and possibly the issues with frailty, are likely continuously shifting towards later chronological age. The main problem is not that the expected value may change, but that normally we imply that "expected values" are what we, as a matter of fact, <i>expect</i>. What is the value of "the expected future value, which, however, we expect to considerably change over time"?

4. For similar reasons, the idea of "biological age" itself becomes problematic. If the "biological age" of 50 means the "typical risk profile for age-related diseases" at 50 years of chronological age, then what happens if the typical risk profile itself changes over time? Technically, if nothing changes for you, but tomorrow the average person begins to live a bit healthier, then your own "biological age" is increasing faster than before!

All these issues would be less serious if we could just focus on the <i><b>rate of aging</b></i>, as it allows us to focus on how things look <i>now</i>, with a less direct relationship to how things might look in 2050.

## Declining, But With A Foot On The Brake

Now, with the advent of <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhl/article/PIIS2666-7568(21)00098-2/fulltext">aging clocks</a>, this is not just theoretical talk. While absolute quantification of the rate-of-aging has similar issues as the "biological age" - in principle, at least - we do not even have to go there. There is more than enough knowledge about the relative differences of various interventions. For instance, chronic inflammation plays a role in a host of issues. Ditching the sun lotion is guaranteed to age your skin faster. Living on wheat buns will kill you faster. Whether each effect has magnitude 1, 5 or 50 on some scale would seem a moot point, as the relative effects are enough to prove the point.

The most robust way of framing this is to compare your present rate of aging to your prior rate of aging. Quite practically, you can ask: Given two possible courses of action, which one of them is expected to decay me less? And, lifting the perspective a notch: is my present lifestyle accelerating me towards the diseases of old age, or is my foot as firmly on the brake as reasonably possible?

Hence, focusing on the rate of aging moves your personal focus from an abstract, fatalistic and confounded expectation of an "arc of life" or a "lifespan" to the life unfolding today. What can you do today to reduce your rate of aging? It completely changes the mainstream'ish narrative of anti-aging technologies, from "What is a good life span?" to "What is a good rate of decay?" (Uhm, 0, anyone?) And, it avoids the very "lifespan" view that is utterly entangled with the idea of fragile, painful and cognitively declined old age. If you reduce your rate of aging, then you are, by definition, going to spend more time without the frailty of old age, no matter how long you turn out to live.

Here, a critic could claim that "Sure, but once you make a few blanket lifestyle changes such as not smoking, then most people might have life span expectation within, say, &plusmn;5 years of the mean, so none of this matters much without some hypothetical future leaps in medical technology."

Fine, but at the moment, the pace of advances is so rapid that I bet it may not be a "&plusmn;5 years" thing for much longer. How much, then?

Well &mdash; that was a trick question! See how easily the mental model of a 'span' creeps in?

In any case, the anti-aging research funding is accelerating quickly (see for example,  <a href="https://www.longevity.technology/1b-longevity-fund-launches-to-pursue-120-lifespan/">1 Billion here</a>, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/09/04/1034364/altos-labs-silicon-valleys-jeff-bezos-milner-bet-living-forever/ ">Jeff Bezos here</a>, and <a href="https://www.longevity.technology/crypto-airdrop-swells-sens-coffers-by-20m-and-climbing/">$20M to Dr. de Grey here</a>, etc.). There are now developments underway to attack aging on the cellular level, grow replacement organs, use stem cell therapies, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhl/article/PIIS2666-7568(21)00098-2/fulltext">actual aging clocks</a> of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01915-x">many kinds</a>, <a href="https://www.gwern.net/docs/longevity/2019-fahy.pdf">proven reversal</a>, etc. etc. (for updates, I recommend <a href="https://www.longevity.technology">Longevity.Technology</a>).

But here is the punch line: <b><i>Every passing year will accelerate the chances of those medical breakthroughs.</i></b>

So, for sure, choosing to live only to 1990 instead of 2000 might not have been game changing. But that is not where your "&plusmn;5 years" are going to land.
You are choosing 2030 instead of 2040. 2040 instead of 2050. 2050… You get the point. And by now, there is ample reason to believe 2040 is going to look stone age in comparison to 2050, not to mention the 2030 we are… oh wait, there's already 9 years of exponential AI-powered progress before that.

As for your next every-day health choice, remember it is not about "Will this make my life shorter or longer?" but "How much will this cost in terms of my decay rate?"

Suddenly, even that $15M CEO salary &mdash; with ultra-high stress and the solid 4 hours of sleep a night &mdash; might not look so attractive after all.
